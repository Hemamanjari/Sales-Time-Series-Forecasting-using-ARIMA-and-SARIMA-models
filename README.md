# Sales-Time-Series-Forecasting-using-ARIMA-and-SARIMA-models
                    A statistical forecasting project which includes end-to-end workflow: data preprocessing, trend &amp; seasonality analysis, model selection (AIC-based), and forecast visualization. Built with Python, Pandas, Statsmodels, and Matplotlib to support data-driven business planning and demand forecasting.
    
Objective
                  The objective of this project is to forecast future sales using Time Series Analysis with ARIMA and SARIMA models.
                  The goal is to provide data-driven sales predictions that can help businesses plan inventory, optimize supply chains, and make informed financial decisions.

Business Context
                  Accurate sales forecasting is crucial for effective business planning and demand management.
                  This project leverages statistical time series models to capture historical sales trends, seasonality, and patterns — ultimately improving forecast accuracy and decision-making for retail operations.

                                              Project Workflow
        1️⃣ Data Collection
                    •	Used a historical sales dataset containing time-stamped sales transactions.
                    •	Data was imported, explored, and cleaned using Pandas and NumPy.
        2️⃣ Data Preprocessing
                    •	Handled missing values and removed outliers.
                    •	Aggregated daily/monthly sales to ensure a uniform time index.
                    •	Checked for stationarity using ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) Test and performed differencing where necessary.
        3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
                    •	Visualized trends, seasonality, and autocorrelation using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
                    •	Generated ACF (Autocorrelation Function) and PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function) plots to determine suitable ARIMA parameters (p, d, q).
        4️⃣ Model Building
                    •	Built multiple ARIMA(p, d, q) models to capture underlying patterns.
                    •	Extended analysis to SARIMA(p, d, q, P, D, Q, s) to account for seasonality.
                    •	Used Grid Search / AIC score optimization to select the best model.
        5️⃣ Model Evaluation
                    •	Evaluated model performance using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error).
                    •	Compared ARIMA vs. SARIMA to assess which model better captures seasonal fluctuations.
        6️⃣ Forecasting
                    •	Forecasted future sales for the next several periods (weeks/months).
                    •	Visualized actual vs. predicted sales using line plots for interpretability.
                    •	Highlighted seasonal peaks and troughs to assist demand planning.

    Results & Insights
                    •	SARIMA outperformed ARIMA, capturing clear seasonal patterns and improving forecast accuracy.
                    •	Detected recurring sales peaks during specific time periods (e.g., holidays or quarterly cycles).
                    •	Generated a forecast visualization for actionable business planning.
                    •	Forecasts can be used for inventory optimization, budget allocation, and promotion timing.

     Key Learnings
                    •	Deep understanding of time series concepts — trend, seasonality, and noise.
                    •	Practical experience in ARIMA/SARIMA modeling and parameter tuning.
                    •	Enhanced skills in data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation.
                    •	Reinforced ability to transform statistical outputs into business insights.
